### Testing Developer Goals

1. I would like to build an engaging quiz for all ages.
- I have tested the quiz out on aselect group of people of young and old ages and they found it to be entertaining.
2. I would like users to talk about the quiz with friends/family to gain more users.
- In testing the group of people also said they would recommend to their friends.
3. I would like to build a colourful quiz to engage users.
- I feel the colours combined with the graphic animations as well as the audio builds to an engaging quiz.
4. I will try to not make the questions so hard it will put people off of playing it.
- I have adjusted some questions as the younger group found at least half quite difficult and need help.

### Testing User Stories

As a user of this quiz, I want:

1. To be able to easily navigate through the quiz.
- After the animation on page load it just takes one click to access the quiz and from there the next question/page has an automatic change on an answer click after a short time. Even the win/lose pages have an easy to see button to restart the quiz.
2. To see responses to know the user has answered a question.
- All buttons have a colour change on hover and after a click an answer is revealed right or wrong by colour and sound.
3. To know if the user has won or lost.
- After each question answer a colour indicates straight away if you are right or wrong. Right answers take you to the next question or all the way to a winner page or an incorrect will take you to the game over page.
4. To be entertained.
- Every person who tried out this quiz found it to be engaging and wanted to play again until they had won.
5. To have fun either by myself or with others.
- I feel the questions are still of a high enough quality that this could be a team quiz for all ages.
